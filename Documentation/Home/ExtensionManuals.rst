            .. rubric:: System Extensions

         .. container:: card-body

            Here you can find documentation of system extensions and third party extensions,
            if available.

            System extensions are shipped with the TYPO3 core. A list of all available
            system extension documentation is found in the
            :ref:`system extensions section <System-Extensions>`.

         .. rst-class:: card-header

            .. rubric:: Third-party extensions

         .. container:: card-body

            Third party extensions are available through the
            `TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER) <https://extensions.typo3.org/>`__ or via composer.

.. Second:
   Don't do anything more!
   Template 'extensions.html' will insert the necessary
   javascript and html to render the extension selection
   form here.

.. How does it work?
   This document has the file-wide-metadata field 'template'
   set to 'extensions.html'. So this document will use the
   template 'extensions.html' for rendering instead of the
   usual 'page.html' of normal pages.
   The logic for this is in __init__.py of t3SphinxThemeRtd,
   which is not only a theme but is loaded as Sphinx extension
   as well.
