What April brings: Cool buttons and "bignums"
---------------------------------------------

2017-04-03 by Martin Bless

Along with April there comes a new release 3.6.8 of our theme `t3SphinxThemeRtd`.
It offers some cool and brandnew stylings for lists that are written
in standard reST markup. You only have to add a `.. rst-class:: the-style` in front of the list.

You can now easily create very well readable step-by-step instructions!

.. rst-class:: bignums

#. Be excited!

   Something new and powerful is now around.

#. About buttons

   Use buttons as links: :ref:`h2document:list-items-as-buttons`

#. Bignums - have numbers appear "big"

   Use :ref:`h2document:styled-numbered-lists` to style sections with
   several steps like these.

In short:

.. rst-class:: horizbuttons-tip-m

-  :ref:`h2document:list-items-as-buttons`
-  :ref:`h2document:styled-numbered-lists`

Use wisely!

The FormEngine code construct of the core has been refactored since version 6.2
