"TYPO3 Explained" menu structure
================================

*2020-07-11 by Sybille Peters*

The menu of :ref:`t3coreapi:start` was considerably changed during and after
the Initiatives Week 2020.

The main goal was to make it easier to find and jump to a general topic.

To achieve this, the subchapters previously in :guilabel:`TYPO3 API overview`
were now moved to the top level. Previously we had several main topics in
:guilabel:`TYPO3 API overview`, some other main topics on the top level (such
as "Testing", "CGL" or "Security") and some smaller subtopics in
:guilabel:`API overview > Examples`. Also, the ordering in "TYPO3 API overview"
was partially alphabetical, partially not. Now we are using an alphabetical
ordering.

To see the "old" menu, look at the
`6.2 version <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/6.2/en-us/ApiOverview/Index.html>`__
but please keep in mind that a number of additional chapter were added since
then. Specifically, several manuals (such as CGL, Security, Inside TYPO3)
were merged into "TYPO3 Explained".

Additionally, the menu was reorganized so that some smaller chapters are
now available via a general chapter:

* "TypoScript syntax", "TSconfig", "Global configuration", etc. are now
  subchapters of the new chapter :ref:`t3coreapi:configuration`.
* "MetaTag API", "PageTitle API" etc were moved to :ref:`t3coreapi:seo`.

While the change was generally met with approval, it does still have some
flaws and could use some more improvements.

For example, the menu is quite long which means you often have to scroll.
If you are in a subchapter that is on the bottom of the menu (for example
:ref:`"Upgrade wizards" <t3coreapi:update-wizards>`) and you are reading
a page, you have to scroll down to select a subchapter of the current
chapter from the menu.

This might be improved, if some more chapters were merged into main chapters.

Additionally, now some small and minor topics are in the top level menu.
This is usually due to the fact, that is not so easy to find a more general
category for a chapter or it could easily be expected to be found in
more than one category. Examples of these are:

* :ref:`t3coreapi:Enumerations`
* :ref:`t3coreapi:pagination`

These are some of the general navigational and structuring
questions that need to be addressed.

**What can you do to help?**

* Ideally create a proof of concept for a better structure and navigation concept
  for "TYPO3 Explained" or the documentation in general. You can
  `create a pull request <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/docs-how-to-document/master/en-us/WritingDocsOfficial/LocalEditing.html>`__
  for this or `contact us on Slack <https://typo3.org/community/teams/documentation>`__.
* Look at the `open issue <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Reference-CoreApi/issues/421>`__
  or all `issues <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Reference-CoreApi/issues>`__ with label
  "content structure" in "TYPO3 Explained"

Snippets
========

*2020-08-04*

The `Snippets <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/docs-snippets/master/en-us/>`__ were
available a number of years and have been helpful. But for quite some time, they
were no longer being used much and no new Snippets were being added.

The main problem currently is that the manual was never versionized, so there is
no way to see for which TYPO3 version the snippet applies. This makes it especially
difficult for newcomers, while experts may still find the information they need
and have no problem figuring out whether it applies to their TYPO3 version.

However, the Matomo results also show, that there is very little traffic to
these pages.

Decreased activity may also be a reflection that people are now using other
platforms, for example Stack Overflow or their own blogs to introduce tips,
small snippets and examples and information on how to do things.

As advertised on the start page, the snippets were never meant to be maintained by the Documentation Team,
which meant everyone was free to add their own snippets, there was no quality
control or entry exam to complete. While this made it very open and inviting,
it had the inherent problem, that there never was an official review. Since
we now have other platforms where you can vote and comment (e.g. Stack Overflow)
or have an author who stands behind the content and has an incentive to keep
it up to date or people just know it is something with an expiration date
and never meant to be kept updated (e.g. blogs) - these may be better suited for this type of content.

On the other hand, it is not easy to take down or deprecate content, people
may find it disruptive and we hate to throw away content that was created
by the community and that served its purpose many years.

Because of this open decision, an `issue <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/T3DocTeam/issues/74>`__
and a `decision <https://decisions.typo3.org/t/what-to-do-with-the-snippets/591>`__
were created which addressed the question of "What to do with the snippets".

**This is now the plan:**

* "Snippets" were removed from main menu on https://docs.typo3.org
* the rendered pages are still available but contain a prominent banner, informing
  about the fact that this manual is not being maintained
* the repository is archived on GitHub

At some time in the future, we may also remove the rendered snippets and redirect
to the https://docs.typo3.org start page. The archived repository on GitHub is still available.

Nothing was thrown away - it will just be less prominent in the future.

**How you can help:**

* Give us feedback on this decision or the structure of the documentation in
  general, either as issues or via Slack
* Help to increase the knowledgebase of useful examples for TYPO3 by contributing to
  Stack Overflow, your blog or the existing documentation. Help to keep existing
  documentation on docs.typo3.org updated.
* When you find information in the Snippets that you think is important and helpful
  to others, see if you can migrate it to a repository which has been versionized to
  Stack Overflow or some other appropriate medium. (Get in touch with the original
  authors to ask permission first!)

Fluid start page
================

*2020-03-12*

A :ref:`Fluid start page <t3coreapi:fluid>` was created in "TYPO3 Explained".
This reflects the importance of Fluid in TYPO3 and the multiple ways it is
now used in TYPO3. A :ref:`t3coreapi:fluid-introduction` subpage was added
as well.

The Fluid page serves as an overview of various ways to use Fluid in TYPO3
as Fluid is now no longer used only in developing Extensions with Extbase &
Fluid as was the case when it was initially introduced.

As **next steps** the documentation could be further restructured, moving
for example general Fluid information that is not specific to Extbase /
Fluid from the :ref:`t3extbasebook:start` to "TYPO3 Explained".

TypoScript Reference
====================

*2020-01-26*

We made several changes to the :ref:`TypoScript reference <t3tsref:start>` and documentation for the
topic TypoScript in general.

**Summary**

* Renamed to "TypoScript Templating Reference"
* Menu was restructured
* Consolidated older versions (finalized migration, ...)
* Added introduction, links to other information and quick links to start page

**In more detail:**

Menu before and after restructuring


#. It was pointed out that the **"TypoScript Reference"** menu was confusing in parts:
   some functions (such as calc and objectSplit) were found under "Objects and Properties",
   top-level objects were hidden in a rubric "setup" etc. This resulted in things not
   being found where they were expected. We managed to simplify the menu and sort the topics accordingly.
#. The use of objects and object types was used inconsistently, some types were referred
   to as "objects" and vice versa. Especially, the term "cObject" was used inconsistently,
   sometimes to refer to the type, sometimes as synonym for "content objects". We corrected
   the use of these terms in some places and added a :ref:`glossary <t3tsref:glossary>`.
#. We renamed "TypoScript Reference" to "TypoScript Templating Reference" because the
   term TypoScript has 2 meanings and in this reference we mean TypoScript templating
   and not (primarily) TypoScript syntax (which is handled in :ref:`t3coreapi:typoscript-syntax-start`
   in "TYPO3 Explained". See `decisions.typo3.org <https://decisions.typo3.org/t/clarification-of-term-typoscript/560/9>`__
   for discussion about this topic.
#. The chapter "Introduction" contained no introduction into the topic - this is a common
   problem in the documentation: There is a chapter "Introduction" where you expect to
   find information about the topic or what the manual is about and often this only contains
   very little information about the manual, credits, how to give feedback etc. For this
   reason we renamed the current Introduction to "About this manual", moved it to the end
   of the menu and added a real :ref:`Introduction <t3tsref:introduction>`.
#. We linked to other manuals where topics are handled in depth (TypoScript in 45 minutes
   and "TypoScript syntax" in "TYPO3 Explained"), both on the start page and in the "Introduction"
#. We added the chapter "Using and setting TypoScript" to the older versions <= 8.7.
   Previously it only existed for versions 9.5 and master (10). (This is due to the fact
   that the migration of some manuals - like "TypoScript Syntax and in depth study"
   was done for version 9.5 and had not been
   performed for previous versions. This is now being done, step by step.)
#. We added "TypoScript Syntax" to older versions <= 8.7 in "TYPO3 Explained".
#. Added quick links to start page


**Further improvements:**

* The topic of using objects and objects types was addressed but could still be improved.
* Additionally, a number of pages could be improved. For example, the page FLUIDTEMPLATE
  could use a better introduction.

Change in Intersphinx Linking
=============================

*2020-01-03*

When linking from one manual to another, we previously always linked to
the latest (master) version of the manual. For example, if you were
reading a section in "TYPO3 Explained" for TYPO3 version 8.7 and were
referred to the "TCA Reference" by clicking a link, you would continue
reading information for the latest TYPO3 version (currently, the
not yet released as LTS version 10.2). Changes between TYPO3
versions are minimal most of the time, but significant in some cases
(for example, see `Changelog for 9.0 <https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/master/en-us/Changelog/9.0/Index.html>`__).

This caused the following problems:

* People who were aware of this but wanted to continue reading
  documentation for the same version had to click multiple times
  (to jump to the requested version) before continuing.
* Often, readers were not aware of this and did not notice the
  change in version. They would then assume, the information
  was correct for the version they started reading in.

Reading documentation on docs.typo3.org should not require knowledge
about such technical details. It should be possible to read and click,
regardless of how the documentation is separated into repositories.

These problems were pointed out in the #typo3-documentation Slack
channel, we created an `issue <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/T3DocTeam/issues/81>`__
and now changed the procedure, so that links across manuals link
to the documentation for the **same TYPO3 version**.
