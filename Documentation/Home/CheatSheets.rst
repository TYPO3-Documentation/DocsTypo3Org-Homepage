TYPO3 CMS cheat sheets

This section holds files, which are related to the TYPO3 CMS Core
documentation, but which do not really fit into any specific manual.

   Do you want **your** cheat sheets to be featured on docs.typo3.org as well?

   Then don't hesitate to `drop us a line <documentation@typo3.org>`__!
