**Migrated manuals**


With our ongoing consolidation efforts, some documents have been merged into other documents
for better overview, less duplication and confusion. The latest versions (since TYPO3 9.5) of
these documents only show a "Has been moved" message. The information has been moved to
:ref:`t3coreapi:start`.

In case information for older TYPO3 versions (8.7 and below) is required, the obsoleted documents
are listed here:
