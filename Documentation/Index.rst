   Usual maximum line length is 79 char plus newline (=80 in total). This
   allows easy online editing and side by side comparisons. Technically lines
   can have any length, and there may be reasons to have longer lines. Try to
   aproximate the 79+1 line lenght whenever you change text anyway.

TYPO3 CMS is an Open Source Enterprise Content Management System powered by
PHP.

Getting Started
===============

*  Follow the :ref:`quick installation guide <t3install:install-via-composer>`
   to install TYPO3 using Composer.

*  The :ref:`t3start:start` introduces you to TYPO3's backend - the interface
   used for managing content and configuring your TYPO3 installation.

*  Add a domain, set up languages and configure URL handling with the
   :ref:`site configuration <sitehandling-basics>` tutorial.

*  Additional resources are available in the :ref:`tutorials` section.

Support is available via StackOverflow and Slack. Visit the `help page
<https://typo3.org/help>`__ for more information.

For information about the different versions of TYPO3 and its system
requirements, visit https://get.typo3.org.


.. _how-the-documentation-is-organized:

How the documentation is organized
==================================

*  :ref:`Tutorials and Guides <tutorials>` contain a comprehensive list of
   resources for both new and existing users of TYPO3 including documentation
   for editors, integrators and developers.

*  :ref:`references` features detailed information about TYPO3's core and is
   intended for integrators and developers.

*  :ref:`System-Extensions` provide a list of all extensions currently used in
   TYPO3's core along with documentation for each of the extensions listed.

*  :ref:`extensions` allow you to search for documentation that has been
   provided for third party extensions.


.. _start-theme:

Templating with Fluid
=====================

TYPO3 uses Fluid as its templating engine. Fluid acts as the glue between your
HTML templates and the content you create in TYPO3. You can find out more about
templating and where to get started by visiting the `Templating Tutorial.
<https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/tutorial-templating/master/en-us/>`__

*  `Backend Layouts
   <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/master/en-us/ApiOverview/BackendLayout/Index.html#be-layout>`__
   join the content you create in TYPO3 to specific points in your HTML
   templates. With backend layouts we are able to map our content to selected
   points in our HTML where we wish to display our content.

*  The `Fluid repository <https://github.com/TYPO3/Fluid>`__ contains further
   information about Fluid. As it is an independent project, the documentation
   is not maintained on docs.typo3.org.

*  `Custom content elements
   <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/master/en-us/ApiOverview/ContentElements/AddingYourOwnContentElements.html#adding-your-own-content-elements>`__
   give us the ability to create our own custom content types.


Manage your templates and more with Sitepackages
================================================

`Sitepackages
<https://www.slideshare.net/benjaminkott/typo3-the-anatomy-of-sitepackages>`__
allow you to bundle your Fluid templates and other site assets into a single,
reusable extension that can be installed with a single click.


.. _start-extdev:

Develop custom extensions
=========================

:ref:`references` lists all relevant core manuals. One of these is
:ref:`t3coreapi:start`. It contains detailed information for core and extension
developers,

Getting started with extension development:

*  :ref:`Introduction to extensions in TYPO3
   <t3coreapi:extension-architecture-introduction>`

*  Extension :ref:`t3coreapi:extension-files-locations`

*  :ref:`t3coreapi:extension-naming` and :ref:`t3coreapi:cgl`

More topics can be found in :ref:`t3coreapi:start`, for example:

*  :ref:`QueryBuilder <t3coreapi:database-query-builder>` based on Doctrine

*  :ref:`t3coreapi:DependencyInjection`
*  :ref:`t3coreapi:request-handling`

If you are updating TYPO3 to the next major version, you may need to make
changes in your custom extensions.

The `Core changelog <https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/master/en-us/>`__
lists all relevant changes for each TYPO3 version since 7.



.. _start-configuration:

   tool that gives backend users the ability to create web forms.

*  :ref:`TypoScript in 45 Minutes <t3ts45:start>` introduces you to TypoScript,
   TYPO3's very own configuration language. TypoScript is used to configure the
   rendering of web pages, navigation menus, page content and much more.
