.. _start-getting-stared:

Getting Started
===============

To find out more information about the different versions of TYPO3 and its system requirements, visit https://get.typo3.org.

Follow the :ref:`Quick installation guide with Composer <t3install:install-via-composer>`
to install TYPO3.

.. code-block:: bash

   composer create-project typo3/cms-base-distribution YourNewProjectFolder

Set up the :ref:`site configuration <sitehandling-basics>` in the backend to configure
the domain, languages, URLs and error pages.

The :ref:`t3start:start` walks you through the backend - the interface for editing
content and configuring the TYPO3 installation. You need a browser and a working
TYPO3 installation.

Find more tutorials in :ref:`tutorials`.
You can ask for support via StackOverflow or Slack.
Find out more on the `help page <https://typo3.org/help>`__


.. _how-the-documentation-is-organized:

How the documentation is organized
==================================

* :ref:`Tutorials and Guides <tutorials>` contain a comprehensive list of resources for both new and existing users of TYPO3 including documentation for editors, integrators and developers.
* :ref:`references` features detailed information about TYPO3's core and is intended for integrators and developers.
* :ref:`System-Extensions` provide a list of all extensions currently used in TYPO3's core along with documentation for each of the extensions listed.
* :ref:`extensions` allow you to search for documentation that has been provided for third party extensions.

.. _start-theme:

Create a theme
==============

*Theme* | *Templating* | *Sitepackage*

It is considered good practice to create a **Sitepackage**. This is an extension which
contains the resources required for a theme.

Sitepackage:

* `Concept of Sitepackages <https://www.slideshare.net/benjaminkott/typo3-the-anatomy-of-sitepackages>`__
* :ref:`t3sitepackage:start`

More introductions:

* The `Fluid documentation <https://github.com/TYPO3/Fluid>`__
  contains information about Fluid. As it is an independent project, the documentation is not
  maintained on docs.typo3.org.
* The system extension :ref:`fluid_styled_content <fsc:start>` handles the rendering of the default
  set of content elements shipped with the core by using the template engine
  `Fluid <https://typo3.org/fluid>`__
* :ref:`Backend layouts <t3coreapi:be-layout>`
* :ref:`Create custom content elements <t3coreapi:adding-your-own-content-elements>`

References

* :ref:`t3tsref:start`
* :ref:`t3viewhelper:start`


.. _start-extdev:

Develop custom extensions
=========================

:ref:`references` lists all relevant core manuals. One of these is
:ref:`t3coreapi:start`. It contains detailed information for core and extension developers,

Getting started with extension development:

* :ref:`Introduction to extensions in TYPO3 <t3coreapi:extension-architecture-introduction>`
* Extension :ref:`t3coreapi:extension-files-locations`
* :ref:`t3coreapi:extension-naming` and :ref:`t3coreapi:cgl`

More topics can be found in :ref:`t3coreapi:start`, for example:

* :ref:`QueryBuilder <t3coreapi:database-query-builder>` based on
  Doctrine
* :ref:`t3coreapi:DependencyInjection`
* :ref:`t3coreapi:request-handling`

If you are updating TYPO3 to the next major version, you may need to make changes
in your custom extensions.

The `Core changelog <https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/master/en-us/>`__ lists
all relevant changes for each TYPO3 version since 7.



.. _start-configuration:

Configure TYPO3
===============

One of the major features of TYPO3 is its configurability. The :ref:`t3coreapi:config-overview`
in "TYPO3 Explained" gives you an overview of various configuration languages.

Specifically, you might want to

* Set up the :ref:`site configuration <sitehandling-basics>` in the backend to configure
  the domain, languages, URLs and error pages.
* Configure :ref:`rte_ckeditor <ckeditor:configuration>`
  to enhance the editing experience when handling rich text editing.
* :ref:`Configure the form system extension <form:quickstartIntegrators>` to create
  custom forms for the frontend.
* :ref:`Configure backend users <t3start:user-management>`


.. _start-localization:

How to create translations
==========================

*Internationalization* | *Translation* | *Multiple Languages*

* :ref:`Supported languages <t3coreapi:i18n_languages>`
* :ref:`Manage backend languages <t3start:changing-backend-language>`
* :ref:`Working with languages as an editor <t3editors:languages>`
* :ref:`t3coreapi:internationalization` in "TYPO3 Explained"
