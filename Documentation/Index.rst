.. important:: Migrate Extension Documentation

   As of May 29th 2019, new infrastructure now powers docs.typo3.org.
   For extensions developers, some :ref:`migration tasks <h2document:migrate>`
   are required to ensure that your extensions documentation is rendered automatically
   on the new infrastructure.

.. sidebar:: New to TYPO3?

   If you are new to TYPO3, it is recommended that you visit the
   :ref:`t3start:start` guide. This is a great resource for new
   users who want to begin using TYPO3.

   The :ref:`Tutorials and Guides <tutorials>` is a comprehensive list
   of guides and tutorials for each area of the CMS.

   For developers, the :ref:`t3coreapi:start` guide covers
   TYPO3's core in detail.

   The :ref:`References <references>` section is a useful guide that
   lists each area of TYPO3's core for further reading.
