What April brings: Cool styles for buttons and "bignums"
--------------------------------------------------------

2017-04-03 by Martin Bless

Along with April there comes a new release 3.6.8 of our theme `t3SphinxThemeRtd`.
It offers some cool and brandnew stylings for lists that are written
in standard reST markup. You only have to add a `.. rst-class:: the-style` in front of the list.

You can now easily create very well readable step-by-step instructions!

.. rst-class:: bignums-tip

#. Be excited!

   Something new and powerful is now around.

#. About buttons

   See `some examples.
   <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/HowToDocument/WritingReST/ListItemsAsButtons/Index.html#available-styles>`__

#. Bignums - have numbers appear "big"

   See `some examples.
   <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/HowToDocument/WritingReST/BignumLists/Index.html#ol-bignums-xxl>`__

In short:

.. rst-class:: horizbuttons-tip-m

-  `Buttons <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/HowToDocument/WritingReST/ListItemsAsButtons/Index.html#available-styles>`__
-  `Bignums <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/HowToDocument/WritingReST/BignumLists/Index.html#ol-bignums-xxl>`__

Use wisely!

The FormEngine code construct of the core has been refactored since version 6.2
