Oudated manuals
===============

With our ongoing consolidation efforts, some documents have been merged into other documents
for better overview, less duplication and confusion. The latest versions of these documents only
show a "Has been moved" message, but in case outdated information for older TYPO3 versions is looked
for, these obsoleted documents are listed here:
